# scala3-template

> A scaffold for creating new starter projects in Scala 3.

**Notes**

- Scaffold is NOT setup for a webservice (like Play) project
- Scaffold is setup for simple starter projects. But projects created out of this template may add Play or http4s or other libraries if required.
- Scaffold comes up with the following dependencies out of the box:
  - cats
  - scalatest
  - scalacheck
